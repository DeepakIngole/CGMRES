# Introduction
This project provides Continuation/GMRES method (C/GMRES method), a fast algorithm of NMPC, and the multiple shooting based C/GMRES method.


# Requirement
- C++11
- Cmake
- Eigen 3
- Python3, numpy, seaborn (for plotsim.py and 2linkanimation.py)
- ffmpeg (to save animations generated by 2linkanimation.py)


# Usage
Write equations of nmpc in nmpc_model.cpp as follows:
